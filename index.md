My research interest lies broadly on topics of **elasticity, geometry and hydrodynamics**. During my PhD I have focused on _instabilities in thin elastic structures (sheets, filaments)_ and _dynamics of solid particles in fluid_. These instabilities have relevance in phenomenon ranging from micro-organismic motility, parcelling liquid droplets to movement of crop and tree canopies in wind.

Particles suspended in fluids are ubiquitous starting from colloidal suspension, dust in atmosphere to collection of droplets inside clouds. The governing equation for the dynamics of these particles, the so called Maxey-Riley equation is a history dependent, integro-differential equation. This equation in general is solved by making specific approximations due to their complexity. But we propose a alternate method to solve them and this gives us new insights that are hitherto unknown.

Recently I have been interested in bio-mechanics of bipods and the kinematics of their locomotion. Though I am not working on it presently, hope to do so in the near future.
