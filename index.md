My research interest lies broadly on topics of **elasticity, geometry and hydrodynamics**. During my PhD I have focused on _instabilities in thin elastic structures_ and _dynamics of solid particles in fluid_. These instabilities have relevance in phenomenon ranging from micro-organismic motility, parcelling liquid droplets to movement of crop and tree canopies in wind.

Recently I have been interested in bio-mechanics of bipods and the kinematics of their locomotion. Though I am not working on it presently, hope to do so in the near future.
