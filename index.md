My research interest lies broadly on **elasticity, geometry and hydrodynamics**. During my PhD I have focused on _instabilities in thin elastic structures (sheets, filaments)_ and _dynamics of solid particles in fluid_.

Small displacement theories in elasticity have become textbook material but the coupling geometry in these theories is weak. Large deformation, geometry bring in fascinating new facets to material behaviour. These are relevant in phenomenon ranging from differential growth problems in nature, micro-organismic motility, micro-fluidic parcelling of liquid droplets to movement of crop and tree canopies in wind. I look at these geometry driven instabilities through table top experiments and theory.

Particles suspended in fluids are ubiquitous starting from colloidal suspension, dust in atmosphere to collection of droplets inside clouds. The paramount hurdle in understanding the dynamics of these particles comes from the complicated nature of the governing equation (Maxey-Riley equations). We are interested in finding new ways to solve this issue without any apriori approximations.

Recently I have been interested in bio-mechanics of bipods and the kinematics of their locomotion. Though I am not working on it presently, hope to do so in the near future.
