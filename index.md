![sgp.png]({{site.baseurl}}/sgp.png){:style="float: right;margin-left: 7px;margin-top: 7px;" :height="30%" width="30%"} I am currently a post-doc in the [Applied Math group](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/softmat/index.html) at [SEAS, Harvard](https://seas.harvard.edu/). I am interested in understanding the behavioral rules behind the **embodied intelligence** of animals and finding ways to replicate them in artificial systems. I am equally interested in designing **smart materials** that leverage geometry for predictive response. To this end I use experiments with animals, build laboratory scale physical models and develop mathematical models to gain insights into a particular phenomena.

My [PhD work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Jo4n4aU79etWbhs4fPXq2DOnauR8BoI/view?usp=sharing) at [ICTS - TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in), Bengaluru was on problems around _instabilities in thin elastic structures (filaments and sheets)_ and also on _dynamics of rigid particles in fluid flows_.

[Research](./research) page has more details on my projects.
