My research interests lie broadly on topics of **elasticity, geometry and hydrodynamics**. During my PhD I have focused on _instabilities in thin elastic structures_ and _dynamics of solid particles in fluid_. These instabilities have relevance in phenomenon ranging from micro-organismic motility, parcelling liquid droplets to movement of crop and tree canopies in wind.

Recently I have been interested in bio-mechanics of bipods and the kinematics of their locomotion. Though I am not working on it presently, hope to do so in the near future.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
