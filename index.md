![sgp.png]({{site.baseurl}}/figs/sgp.png){:style="float: right;margin-left: 7px;margin-top: 7px;" :height="30%" width="30%"} I am currently a post-doc in the [Applied Math group](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/softmat/index.html) at [SEAS, Harvard](https://seas.harvard.edu/). My interest lies in developing a physical and mathematical understanding of animal and robot behavior. I have a continued interest in mechanics of materials, currently focused around material design. To this end I perform experiments with animals, build laboratory scale physical realizations and construct mathematical models to gain insights into the particular phenomena of interest.

My [PhD work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Jo4n4aU79etWbhs4fPXq2DOnauR8BoI/view?usp=sharing) at [ICTS - TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in), Bengaluru was on problems around _instabilities in thin elastic structures (filaments and sheets)_ and also on _dynamics of rigid particles in fluid flows_.

[Research](./research) page has more details on my research projects.
