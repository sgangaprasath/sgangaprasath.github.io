S Ganga Prasath is a graduate student at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](www.icts.res.in), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bengaluru. His research interests lie in problems related to **elasticity, geometry and hydrodynamics**. His PhD is focused around _instabilities in thin elastic structures (sheets, filaments)_ and _dynamics of solid particles in flows_.

Please see the Research section for a detailed description of the problems he works on. They can broadly be described as follows:

**Elasticity and geometry**

Small displacement theories in elasticity have become textbook material but the coupling of geometry in these theories is weak. Large deformation and geometry bring in fascinating new facets to material behaviour which can then be leveraged for desirable work. These are relevant in phenomenon ranging from differential growth problems in nature, micro-organismic motility, micro-fluidic parcelling of liquid droplets to movement of crop and tree canopies in wind. He looks at these instabilities through table top experiments and theory.

**Hydrodynamics of particles**

Particles suspended in fluids are ubiquitous starting from colloidal suspension, phytoplankton motion in ocean, suspended particulate matter in atmosphere to collection of droplets inside clouds. The paramount hurdle in understanding the dynamics of these particles comes from the complicated nature of the governing equation (Maxey-Riley equations). He is interested in finding new ways to solve this issue without any apriori approximations.
