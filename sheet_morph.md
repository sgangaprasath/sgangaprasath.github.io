**Filament/Sheet morphologies**

Droplets transported through microfluidic devices are prone to interacting with boundary walls and the contents being polluted. A safe transport mechanism predicates a rigid covering for such small droplets. One way to achieve this is by covering the droplet using thin plastic sheets. Using elasticity theory we explore the phase-space of different shapes a sheet takes when in contact with a liquid droplet. The phase-space is rich with several instabilities which we explore using experiments and asymptotic calculations.
