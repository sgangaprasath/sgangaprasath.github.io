## Rigid objects in flow

The Maxey-Riley equations describe the dynamics of inertial particles in a flow field. These are integro-differential equations in particle velocity, and a particle's velocity at a given time instant depends on the particle velocity along the entire trajectory of the particle starting from the initial time instant. This non-local term called the Basset history integral has presented a technical difficulty in understanding the particle dynamics. We made the problem local in time leveraging a special map and using the map we find exact solution to several flow scenarios. For complex flow scenarios we develop a spectrally accurate numerical scheme without accruing memory costs.
