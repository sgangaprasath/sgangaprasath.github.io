## Dealing with Basset-history integral

Maxey-Riley equations describe the dynamics of inertial particles in a flow field. These equations are integro-differential equations in particle velocity, and a particle's velocity at a time instant depends on the entire trajectory of the particle uptil that time instant. This non-local term called the Basset history integral has been a technical difficulty in understanding the particle dynamics. We show that we can map the history integral as Neumann condition to 1-D heat equation, thus making the problem local in time. Using this map we find exact solution to several flow scenarios and also develop a spectrally accurate numerical scheme for arbitrary non-linear flow fields.
