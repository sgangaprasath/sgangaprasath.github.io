## Dealing with Basset-history integral

Maxey-Riley equations describe the dynamics of inertial particles in a flow. These are integro-differential equations in particle velocity, and a particle's velocity at a time instant depends on the entire trajectory of the particle. This history term called the Basset history integral has been a technical difficulty in understanding the particle dynamics and we show that we can map the history integral as Neumann condition to 1-D heat equation. Using this map we find exact solution to several flow scenarios and a spectrally accurate numerical scheme for arbitrary flow fields.
