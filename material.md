## Advanced materials
<!-- 
Meta-materials leverage geometry to achieve deviant physical properties. The many examples of such materials pervade the art and architecture world with origami and kirigami being the archetypes. We develop a new class of "Neutrally Stable" materials called **Totimorphs** with zero-stiffness that can be assembled to produce positive, negative and zero Poisson ratio. And these materials can morph between a tunable family of states without energy expenditure.
