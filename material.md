## Totimorphs - infinitely morphable structures
Morphable structures are realized by using microscopic degrees of freedom to sculpt the free energy landscape of a material structure. The ability to design such a free energy landscape is limited by the constraints of topology and geometry of the structure. We explore a new class of pre-stressed materials which are infinitely morphable because of a flat energy landscape. We create an assembly that can be morphed into arbitrarily complex target shapes. The fabricated prototypes show that our design strategy opens up new possibilities for fabricating functional material structures.

## Functional soft gel vascular networks
Vascularization, the formation of a branched network of vessels, enables the transport of nutrients and removal of wastes in biological organisms. In plants and animals, vascularization is self-organized in response to biochemical and biophysical cues. We use flow induced channelization in a crosslinkable gel to enable the controlled formation of synthetic vasculature in soft frangible tissue-like materials. This allows us to control and guide the formation of both divergent and convergent channel patterns, hierarchical formation of thick and thin capillaries, all the while being space-filling.

Meta-materials leverage geometry to achieve deviant physical properties. The many examples of such materials pervade the art and architecture world with origami and kirigami being the archetypes. We develop a new class of "Neutrally Stable" materials called **Totimorphs** with zero-stiffness that can be assembled to produce positive, negative and zero Poisson ratio. And these materials can morph between a tunable family of states without energy expenditure.
