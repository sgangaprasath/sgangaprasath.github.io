## Totimorphs - infinitely morphable structures
Morphable structures are often realized by using microscopic degrees of freedom to sculpt the free energy landscape of a material structure. Such structures can be driven by an external stimulus between different configurations that are the minima in the energy landscape. The ability to design such a free energy landscape is however limited by the constraints implied by the connectivity and geometry of the elastic structure. Here we explore a new class of pre-stressed materials that we call totimorphs, which are infinitely morphable as a result of the energy landscape being flat. We describe a mechanism by which a unit of zero stiffness structure can be assembled to create objects that can morph into multiple arbitrarily complex target shapes. We fabricate prototypes of the designed structures using additive manufacturing techniques where we observe the morphability manifest itself as soft-modes in the system. Our design strategy opens up new possibilities for fabricating shape morphing functional material structures.

## Functional soft gel vascular networks
Vascularization, the formation of a branched network of vessels, enables the transport of nutrients and removal of wastes in biological organisms. In plants and animals, vascularization is self-organized in response to biochemical and biophysical cues. However, in synthetic organ systems, one of the main challenges in scaling up organoids has been proper vascularization of the tissues. We use flow induced channelization in a crosslinkable gel to enable the controlled formation of synthetic vasculature in soft frangible tissue-like materials. This allows us to control and guide the formation of both divergent and convergent channel patterns, hierarchical formation of thick and thin capillaries, all the while being space-filling.

Meta-materials leverage geometry to achieve deviant physical properties. The many examples of such materials pervade the art and architecture world with origami and kirigami being the archetypes. We develop a new class of "Neutrally Stable" materials called **Totimorphs** with zero-stiffness that can be assembled to produce positive, negative and zero Poisson ratio. And these materials can morph between a tunable family of states without energy expenditure.
