## Decision making using the classic game of Roulette


People make trade-offs in a variety of day-to-day activities. Let us consider the task of walking, people walk at a reasonable speed, not too fast since higher speed has higher risk to falling and not too slow as it is highly inefficient. So people make a trade-off between risk and efficiency during this simple task. Though seemingly simple, it is hard to quantify how these trade-offs are made. We are interested in understanding how people make trade-offs between speed and accuracy in simple physical processes.

We use the game of Roulette as a route to understand speed-accuracy tradeoffs in motor planning and task execution. Roulette is a classic game where participants of the game have to bet where a ball will land up on a rotating board.
