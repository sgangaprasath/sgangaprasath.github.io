## Decision making using the classic game of Roulette


People make trade-offs in a variety of day-to-day activities. Let us consider the task of walking, people walk at a reasonable speed, not too fast since higher speed has higher risk to falling and not too slow as it is highly inefficient. So people make a trade-off between risk and efficiency during this simple task. Though seemingly simple, it is hard to quantify how these trade-offs are made. We are interesting in understanding how people make trade-offs between speed and accuracy in simple physical processes.

We use the game of Roulette as a route to understand speed-accuracy tradeoffs in motor planning and task execution. Roulette is a classic game where participants of the game have to bet where a ball will land up on a rotating board. The reward in this game is such that the faster you make an accurate bet, larger is the reward. This reward decays rapidly with time even if accurate, thus forcing the participant to bet quickly and accurately. However, when you bet fast the error associated with that bet is expected to be high. The reward is dependent on this error such that larger the error, lower is the reward. Thus there is an optimal betting time for each participant depending on their acumen to achieve maximum reward.
