## Discussions on Policy, Science & Society, Arts and Humanities

As part of the student collective at ICTS, I along with [Adhip Agarwala](https://www.icts.res.in/people/adhip-agarwala) organise monthly talks on a variety of topics ranging from policy, science - how it affects the society and arts.

Through these talks we try to engage the scientific community in a conversation with specialists in a given field or an issue. These discussions are aimed at getting informed, to think and if possible even address pertinent questions that surround us.

The video recording of the discussions can be viewed here: [Sthayi Talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDGuCURnEg47eZv5eDgyJng)
