## Discussions on Policy, Science & Society, Arts and Humanities

As part of the student collective, I along with [Adhip Agarwala](https://www.icts.res.in/people/adhip-agarwala) organise monthly talks on a variety of topics ranging from policy, science and how it affects the society and arts.

Through these talks we try to engage the scientific community at ICTS in a conversation with specialists in a given field or an issue. These discussions are aimed at getting informed, to think and if possible even address pertinent questions that surround us.

The video recordings of the discussion can be viewed here: [Sthayi Talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDGuCURnEg47eZv5eDgyJng)
