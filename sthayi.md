## Talks on Policy, Science & Society, Arts and Humanities

As part of the student collective at ICTS, I along with [Adhip Agarwala](https://www.icts.res.in/people/adhip-agarwala) and [Abhishodh Prakash](https://sites.google.com/view/abhishodh/home?authuser=0) organise monthly talk on a variety of topics ranging from policy, science - how it affects society and arts.

Through these talks we try to engage the scientific community in a conversation with specialists in a given field or an issue. These discussions are aimed at getting informed, to think and if possible even address pertinent questions that surround us.

The video recording of the discussions can be viewed here: [Sthayi Talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDGuCURnEg47eZv5eDgyJng)
