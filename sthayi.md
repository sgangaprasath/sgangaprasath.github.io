## Talks on Policy, Science & Society, Arts and Humanities
![sthayi_title.png]({{site.baseurl}}/figs/sthayi_title.png)

When I was at ICTS, as part of the student collective, I along with [Adhip Agarwala](https://adhipagarwala.wordpress.com), Abha Jeurkar and [Abhishodh Prakash](https://sites.google.com/view/abhishodh/home?authuser=0) used to organise monthly talks on a variety of topics from policy, science - how it affects society and arts.

Through these talks we tried to engage the scientific community in a conversation with specialists in a given field or an issue. These discussions aimed at getting informed, to think and if possible even address pertinent questions that surround us.

The video recording of the discussions can be viewed here: [Sthayi Talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDGuCURnEg47eZv5eDgyJng)
