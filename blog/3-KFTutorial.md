We look at the derivation of the famous Kalman filter starting with the least-squares fit.
The folder attached in this [link](https://github.com/sgangaprasath/KFTutorial/tree/main) contains the `python` code that goes along with the detailed tutorial (`pdf` is available [here](https://github.com/sgangaprasath/Publications/raw/master/KFTutorial.pdf)).
`KFTutorial.ipynb` in the folder is the jupyter-notebook to simulate 4 problems:
<ol>
  <li>Least-squares fit/estimation of a time-series data</li>
  <li>Recursive least-square estimator </li>
  <li>A simple 1-dimensional stochastic differential equation</li>
  <li>Using Kalman-Bucy filter to estimate the position of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential</li>
</ol>

 The folder also contains the LaTeX-sources files and figures in the article.

 This work was done in collaboration with [Vishaal Krishnan](https://vishaal-krishnan.github.io).
