## Elastic instabilities

In this tutorial series we will look at a few of the fundamental instabilities seen in thin elastic structures. These are elastica & Euler beam buckling, morphology of hair, wrinking of thin sheets under different boundary conditions.

$$ x' = \cos \theta$$
$$ y' = \sin \theta$$
