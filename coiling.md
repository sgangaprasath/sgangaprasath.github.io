**Instabilities driven by geometry**
When a stress-free filament is floated on a think flat film, it takes the shape of a staight line as this configuration has minimum energy. On the other hand confining it to non-planar surfaces with finite Gaussian curvature forces it to take bent shapes. Are these shapes special in any manner? We explore this question through experiments on soap films and develop theory accounting for geometry effects.
