**Filament/Sheet morphologies**
Droplets transported through microfluidic devices are prone to interaction with boundary walls and the contents being polluted. A safe transport mechanism predicates a rigid covering for small droplets. This can be achieved by covering the droplet using thin-sheets. Using elasticity theory we explore the phase-space of different shapes a sheet takes when in contact with a liquid droplet. The phase-space is rich with several instabilities which we explore using experiments and asymptotic calculations.

**Coiling instability**


**Large deformation dynamics**
Elastic filaments in a viscous fluid under small deformation take infinite time to relax when acted upon by bending and viscous forces. But under large deformation, geometric constraints make the dynamics non-trivial due to a new tangential stress. Using results from such a simple model system we try to extend the implications to micro-organismic locomotion.
