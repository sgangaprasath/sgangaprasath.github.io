**Instabilities driven by geometry**
When a stress-free filament is floated on a think flat film, it takes the shape of a staight line as this configuration has minimum energy. On the other hand confining it to non-planar surfaces with finite Gaussian curvature forces it to take bent shapes. Are these shapes special in any manner? We explore this question through experiments on soap films and develop theory accounting for geometry effects.

**Filament/Sheet morphologies**
Droplets transported through microfluidic devices are prone to interacting with boundary walls and the contents being polluted. A safe transport mechanism predicates a rigid covering for such small droplets. One way to achieve this is by covering the droplet using thin plastic sheets. Using elasticity theory we explore the phase-space of different shapes a sheet takes when in contact with a liquid droplet. The phase-space is rich with several instabilities which we explore using experiments and asymptotic calculations.

Elastic filaments in a viscous fluid under small deformation take infinite time to relax when acted upon by bending and viscous forces. But under large deformation, geometric constraints arising out of material behaviour such as preservation of length make the filament dynamics highly non-linear. We show that the estimates on energy dissipation from linear theory is drasticaly different from the non-linear one and extend implications to micro-organismic locomotion. To our surprise we found out that asymmetric shapes of filament being more unstable than symmetric shapes.
