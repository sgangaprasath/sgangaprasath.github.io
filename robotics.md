## Cooperative task execution
What are the sufficient rules for cooperation? Can cooperation arise only out of mechanistic interactions? How is collective decision reflected in day-to-day tasks? We probe aspects of cooperation in carpenter ants and identify a minimal set of behavioural rules required for cooperation in a robotic platform consisting of ant-like robots that can both physically interact and communicate through a virtual pheromone field. The different phases of cooperation and tasks provides new insights into how the biological world might behave as a super-organism with only local behavioural rules.

<!-- Biomimicry has been a niche theme in robotics research. Though this approach has led to novel designs adaptible to natural conditions, it has had limited success due to large degrees of freedom of the robots which makes the system difficult to control. We take a stochastic approach to bio-inspired design where the tools of statistical mechanics, designed to result in average success but with high robustness can be leveraged for desideratum, and this provides a new path for robotics.-->
