## Robotics and Animal behaviour
Tinbergen in 1963 laid out the fundamental questions for the field of animal behaviour. They are identifying the function, evolution, causation and development of a particular behavior. Such a framework, however, has yet to appear for robotics. One solution to resolve this void is to understand the behaviour of animals and use the insights we gain towards a specific function in robots.

**Cooperative task execution**
What are the sufficient rules for cooperation? Can cooperation arise only out of mechanistic interactions? How is collective decision reflected in tasks? Can we leverage cooperation for a particular task? We identify the interaction rules between the agents and the environment, mediated through communication channels that result in cooperation in a colony of carpenter ants and replicate the behaviour in a robotic platform consisting of ant-like robots that can communicate with each other and physically interact with its environment. Using this understanding we show that robots can collectively perform both construction and de-construction with simple changes in behavioral rules. See the article for further details.
