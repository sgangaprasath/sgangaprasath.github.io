## Robotics and Animal behaviour
Tibergen in 1963 laid out the fundamental questions for the field of animal behaviour. They are identifying the function, evolution, causation and development of a particular behavior. Such a framework, however, has yet to appear for robotics. One solution to resolve this void is to understand the behaviour of animals and use the insights we gain towards a specific function in robots.

**Mechanics of cooperation**
What are the sufficient rules for cooperation? Can cooperation arise only out of mechanistic interactions? How is collective decision reflected in tasks? We identify the interaction rules between the agents and the environment, mediated through communication channels that result in cooperation in a colony of carpenter ants and replicate the behaviour in a robotic platform consisting of ant-like robots that can communicate with each other and physically interact with its environment. See the article for further details.
