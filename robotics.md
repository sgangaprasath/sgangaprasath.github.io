## Embodied intelligence

## Cooperative task execution
What are the sufficient rules for cooperation? Can cooperation arise only out of mechanistic interactions? How is collective decision reflected in day-to-day tasks? We probe aspects of cooperation in carpenter ants and identify a minimal set of behavioural rules required for cooperation in a robotic platform consisting of ant-like robots that can both physically interact and communicate through a virtual pheromone field. The different phases of cooperation and tasks provides new insights into how the biological world might behave as a super-organism with only local behavioural rules.
