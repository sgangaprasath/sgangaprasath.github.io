## Collective robotics

<!-- Biomimicry has been a niche theme in robotics research. Though this approach has led to novel designs adaptible to natural conditions, it has had limited success due to large degrees of freedom of the robots which makes the system difficult to control. We take a stochastic approach to bio-inspired design where the tools of statistical mechanics, designed to result in average success but with high robustness can be leveraged for desideratum, and this provides a new path for robotics.-->
