## Biomimetic Robotics

## Collective cooperation
What are the sufficient rules for cooperation? Can cooperation arise only out of mechanistic interactions? We explore the minimal set of behavioural rules required for cooperation in a robotic platform consisting of ant-like robots that can both physically interact and communicate through a virtual pheromone field. The different phases of cooperation provide new insights into how the biological world might behave as a super-organism with only simple behavioural rules.

<!-- Biomimicry has been a niche theme in robotics research. Though this approach has led to novel designs adaptible to natural conditions, it has had limited success due to large degrees of freedom of the robots which makes the system difficult to control. We take a stochastic approach to bio-inspired design where the tools of statistical mechanics, designed to result in average success but with high robustness can be leveraged for desideratum, and this provides a new path for robotics.-->
