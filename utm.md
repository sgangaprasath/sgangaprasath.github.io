## [](#header-2) Unified Transform Method

Linear partial differential equations are abundant in all areas of physics and engineering. However we are not taught to solve a general _n_-th order PDE with a given set of boundary conditions. However using the recently developed technique of Fokas, also known as Unified Transform Method (UTM), to solve linear PDEs generalises all special techniques such as separation of variables, sine transform, method of characteristics into a general form that extends beyond simple equations such as heat equation, wave equation or advection equation.
